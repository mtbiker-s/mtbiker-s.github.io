## Interests

I enjoy being able to spend time with my family, jamming on guitar, bass or keyboards with my son, or just reading horror, fantasy and sci-fi books or movies of the same genre.

Being outdoors is my other passion ejoying activities like mountain biking, snowboarding, hiking, running or just being outside exploring in the woods.

Other pastimes and hobbies include cooking, tinkering with computers, learning new tech. I always like to keep engaged by teaching or learning, wether it's a new song to play, a new programming language or tech stack.
